# fallen-vim

> *“All glory fades. What remains is the code, written in silence.”*

**Fallen Knight** is a somber, dark colorscheme for Vim. Inspired by the image of a once-great warrior stripped of honor, dignity, and light. It provides a visually comfortable coding experience for those who remain in the shadows but still press on. Designed for long hours of focused programming, this theme is minimal, legible, easy on eyes

- Low brightness, high contrast: reduces eye strain during night sessions
- Muted, battle-worn tones with subtle color accents
- Compatible with both terminal Vim and GUI (GVim, Neovim)
- True to its theme: every color has a weight, a purpose
