# fallen-vim

> *‚ÄúAll glory fades. What remains is the code, written in silence.‚Äù*

**Fallen Knight** is a somber, dark colorscheme for Vim. Inspired by the image of a once-great warrior stripped of honor, dignity, and light. It provides a visually comfortable coding experience for those who remain in the shadows but still press on. Designed for long hours of focused programming, this theme is minimal, legible, easy on eyes
